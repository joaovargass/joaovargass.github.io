Projeto de formatura do aluno João Vitor Vargas Soares de conclusão do curso de Engenharia de Computação da Escola Politécnica da USP feito em inglês.




This project is based on the internship the student did during their double degree exchange program in France at the university of Grenoble INP. This is the adaptation of the End of Studies project done by the student at the company Procter & Gamble, focusing on the research of the relationship between data analysis and digital marketing in the modern world where new digital marketing compliance rules, such as GPDR, are now in effect. The internship was divided in two main projects: consumer first-party data acquisition and media activation; Retail data and collaboration using Amazon Marketing Cloud.

# Marketing Technology: a study on compliance, acquisition and usage of first-party data in digital marketing
Projeto de formatura do aluno João Vitor Vargas Soares de conclusão do curso de Engenharia de Computação da Escola Politécnica da USP feito em inglês.

## Objectives

This project is based on the internship the student did during their double degree exchange program in France at the university of Grenoble INP. This is the adaptation of the End of Studies project done by the student at the company Procter & Gamble, focusing on the research of the relationship between data analysis and digital marketing in the modern world where new digital marketing compliance rules, such as GPDR, are now in effect. The internship was divided in two main projects: consumer first-party data acquisition and media activation; Retail data and collaboration using Amazon Marketing Cloud.

## Project 1: Consumer first-party data acquisition and media activation

This project had the intent of collecting and activating consumer first-party data for P&G’s grooming brands based on the company’s fiscal year targets. Data activation is unlocking value in data through development of insights and turning those insights into action. The discussion of the change on data collection mechanisms and types in digital marketing is discussed here too, once new data regulations are in effect now in Europe.

## Project 2: 

The second project had the goal of using the digital marketing platform Amazon Marketing Cloud to collect and analyze consumer data with the purpuse of answering Procter & Gamble’s predefined business questions, using Python to analyze the data. AMC is a cloud-based clean room that contains information about sales and consumer activity on Amazon’s website and can be accessed using SQL queries.

								<h1>Consumer first-party<br />
								data acquisition and <br />
								analysis
								</h1>
								<p>
									This project revolves around the analysis of digital marketing data from a consumer goods company, with a 
									specific focus on the grooming segment of the company's operations, encompassing two separate sub-projects. 
									The first involves quantifying unidentified potential grooming consumers across all of the company's databases 
									in five countries to refine targeting strategies. The second sub-project analyzes Amazon Marketing Cloud data to 
									extract insights on consumer behavior and preferences on Amazon's website, addressing predefined business questions. Through these 
									endeavors, valuable insights are derived to optimize marketing efforts and stimulate growth in the grooming segment.

							<h2>Context</h2>
							<p>
								This project was made during an internship experience I had during a double degree exchange program at the University 
								of Grenoble INP in France. The report was then used as a thesis for my graduation project at the University of São Paulo.
								The internship was undertaken at a consumers goods multinational, with a specific emphasis 
								on exploring the interplay between data analysis and digital marketing in the contemporary landscape marked by the 
								enforcement of new digital marketing compliance regulations such as <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="General Data Protection Regulation" data-tooltip-fit>GDPR</span>. The internship comprised two primary projects: 
								the acquisition and activation of consumer <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-medium data-tooltip-message="Information collected directly from users or customers by a company, typically	through interactions with its own platforms or channels">first-party data</span>, as well as the exploration of retail data through the 
								utilization of Amazon Marketing Cloud.
							</p>
							<h2>Objectives</h2>
							<h3>Sub-project 1: Grooming first-party data acquisition</h3>
							<p>
								The main goal of the first project was to quantify the number of potential grooming consumers that were not identified as 
								such in the databases owned by the company, across five different countries in Europe: Italy, Spain, UK, France, and 
								Germany. This involved gathering and utilizing consumer 
								<span data-tooltip data-tooltip-medium data-tooltip-message="Information collected directly from users or customers by a company, typically	through interactions with its own platforms or channels">first-party data</span> 
								for the company's grooming brands, aligning 
								with the company's fiscal year objectives. Additionally, the discussion covers changes in data collection methods and 
								types in digital marketing, particularly addressing the impact of new data regulations currently in effect in Europe.
							</p>
							<h3>Sub-project 2: Consumer data analysis from Amazon's website</h3>
							<p>
								The aim of the second project was to utilize the Amazon Marketing Cloud digital marketing platform for gathering and 
								analyzing grooming consumers data. The objective was to tackle the company's pre-defined business questions, utilizing Python 
								for data analysis. The Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) platform functions as a cloud-based clean room containing 
								information about sales and consumer engagement on Amazon's website, accessible via SQL queries.
							</p>
							<h2>Used technologies</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Jupyter Notebooks and Python libraries (pydata_google_auth, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, google.cloud, openpyxl)</li>
								<li>Amazon Marketing Cloud</li>
								<li>Google Cloud Platform's tools BigQuery and Vertex AI Workbench</li>
							</ul>

							</ul>

							<h3>Project implementation</h3>
							<p>
								The main objective of this sub-project was to find on the company's predefined databases consumers that could be potential 
								grooming product buyers. These consumers must comply to some contrains defined on the system requirements. To find these 
								consumers, some queries were constructed and the final result was displayed on a table for all five countries in analysis.
							</p>
							<h4>Selecting Marketing Program Numbers</h4>
							<p>
								This analysis encompassed five distinct countries: Italy, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Each country and brand is associated 
								with its unique Marketing Program Number (MPN) within the selected databases. An MPN is an exclusive identifier assigned to a
								 marketing plan devised by the company, encompassing all tasks aimed at boosting sales for a specific brand or a group of brands, 
								 categorized by country. Each of the selected grooming brands possess its dedicated MPN corresponding to the country under 
								 examination. To retrieve the necessary Marketing Program Numbers, a query was executed directly from BigQuery’s interface.
							</p>
							<h4>Defining queries' constraits</h4>
							<p>
								To ensure compliance with system requirements needing gender and age information for all consumers, the verification process must 
								be integrated into the queries. The database contains various potential gender values. Therefore, before selecting consumers based 
								on this data, it is crucial to identify and consolidate all available gender values within the database. Consequently, the only 
								acceptable values for gender become 'm' or 'f'.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another constraint defined on the system requirements is that a consumer must be active on the past 12 months. To select the active 
								consumers, the events that the consumer participates that are not considered as active need to be defined. Then, the last time the 
								consumer has been active needs to be verified on all tables related to events. After that, the events considered as not active were 
								excluded from this verification, resulting on a list of userId’s that are active on the past 12 months.
							</p>
							<p>
								The next constraint is regarding the email marketing communications. The consumers that have agreed to receive email marketing 
								communications need to be selected by verifying the database column that contains that information.
							</p>
							<p>
								One final constraint needs to be added to the analysis, which is related to the analysis done in Italy. In Italy, the databases 
								have been through a cleaning regarding <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="General Data Protection Regulation" data-tooltip-fit>GDPR’s</span> 
								regulations, which is related to the consent given by the user to allow the usage 
								of their data. This information is on a column present on the databases, which needs to be verified on all Italian databases analysis.
							</p>
							<h4>Queries created</h4>
							<h5>Consumer traits query</h5>
							<p>
								The first query created had the intent of looking for consumer traits that have grooming related terms on its name. A consumer trait 
								is a user attribute such as name, gender, city, but also computed traits, like the answers of a survey. Regular expression functions 
								were used to search for grooming related traits. The grooming traits and all the unique userId’s related to them that are present on 
								the chosen databases were selected. After selecting them, there was an exclusion of: the userId’s that were already present on any 
								of the grooming databases; the traits that have less then 10,000 userId’s associated to them. Finally, all the constrains mentioned 
								before were applied to get the final results containing the number of unique consumers related to each consumer trait.
							</p>
							<h5>Consumer sources query</h5>
							<p>
								The next query created was regarding the sources from where the consumer data has come from. The first thing done was getting a 
								list of all of the sources of information available. With the sources selected, the next step is to select the ones that are 
								related to grooming and get all of the consumers that have them as a source. To verify if the source is grooming related, 
								regular expresions were used on the description and name of the source by verifying if there were any grooming terms on them. 
								As it was done for the traits query, the constraints defined before were also applied to get the final result containing the 
								number of userId's for each source.
							</p>
							<h5>Consumer events query</h5>
							<p>
								The events query was done based on the events selected as meaningful for grooming brands. User events are user activity 
								(clicks, views, orders) on a touchpoint. All of the selected consumers are unique, meaning that their userId appears only 
								once at the results of the analysis. The events selected on the queries were: email events, coupon events, receipt events 
								and cashback events. After selecting all consumers related to these events, the contraints defined before were applied 
								resulting on a list of events and the number of unique consumers that are related to those events. 
							</p>
							<h5>All consumers query</h5>
							<p>
								The query includes the merge of all of the sources, traits and events SQL queries, as well as the constraints that were defined, 
								resulting on a final number of unique users that could be potential grooming consumers.
							</p>
							<h3>Results</h3>
							<p>
								The results for each country are shown on the table below. <i>Total Users</i> is the number of the users that have gender and 
								age information and that are related to at least one 
								<span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="A consumer attribute that is directly related to grooming, e.g., the type of shaver that the user owns, which brand of shaver" data-tooltip-medium>grooming golden trait</span>
								, event or source. <i>Opt-in users</i> are the 
								<i>Total Users</i> with the restriction of having agreed to receiving email marketing communications. <i>Active users</i> 
								are the <i>Total Users</i> with the restriction of being active on the past 12 months. <i>Active and Opt-in Users</i> are 
								the number of users with both restrictions. The percentage of Male and Female consumers with both restrictions is also 
								quantified on the table below.

									<caption>Table 1: Potential grooming consumers analysis results</caption>
								</table>
								<p>
									By examining the results of the analysis, it is possible to see that for all countries the major part of consumers are 
									female, and that for the greater part of them most of the consumers are active and accepted to be contacted by email marketing. 
									This means that majority of the consumers are considered potential grooming consumers, which is the main point of this 
									analysis. Germany and Italy are the only countries that have less then half the total consumer as potential grooming 
									consumers, meaning that their consumers are not as active as on the other countries and that the majority of them do not agree 
									to be contacted via email marketing.

							<h2>Sub-project 2: Consumer data analysis from Amazon's website</h2>
							<p>
								The objective of this project was to analyze Amazon Marketing Cloud's consumer data to answer the business questions provided by the company. 
								The implementation and results were divided in five topics, each one answering one of the questions. There were two grooming brands 
								in analysis, which will be defined as GB1 (Grooming Brand 1) and GB2 (Grooming Brand 2) for legal reasons.
							</p>
							<h3>Business questions</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>What are the optimal marketing campaign settings related to the number of times an advertisement is shown to the customer (frequency cap) and the times when most sales occur (day parting) for <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Advertisements</span>?</li>
								<li>How do different types of advertising placements on the Amazon website work together (<span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website.

							</ul>
							<h3>Implementation and results</h3>
							<h4>Frequency cap and day parting</h4>
							<p>
								The objective of this part of the analysis was to understand, for <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Advertisements</span>, what is the division of advertisements displayed 
								during the day (day parting) and what is the optimal frequency cap to be set for displaying them, in other words, how many advertisements 
								they should be displayed to a consumer for each marketing campaign set up on a period of 30 days to get the best results in terms of 
								purchases. This is important to know because Amazon charges their advertisements per impression and per clicks (how many times the 
								advertisement was clicked), meaning that a maximum value of times an advertisement is displayed need to be set up so that the ratio between 
								the money spent on a campaign and the return in sales is the best.
							</p>
							<p>
								Two queries were used on AMC to get the information needed for the analysis, one for day parting and one for frequency cap. The queries 
								were executed per month, meaning the date range selected on AMC was of a month, and also per brand.
							</p>
							<p>
								For day parting, the main <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Key Performance Indicator" data-tooltip-fit>KPI</span> used to understand how the campaign has performed is the purchase rate, which was calculated for each hour 
								of the day. After calculating the purchase rate per hour, a chart was plot for each marketing campaign in analysis. On this chart, besides 
								the purchase rate per hour, the percentage of the total daily impressions a campaign has received is displayed too, also divided by hour 
								of the day. One of the results of this analysis for GB1 is shown on the chart below. It is possible to see that the time of the day that 
								this specific campaign receives the most impressions is during the night, but the best purchase rate happens during the morning period.
							</p>
							<div class="image center"><img class="center" src="https://github.com/joaovargass/joaovargass.github.io/assets/39708920/fe9a19a1-f7cc-458f-8ed4-a96d5f9b6fc6" alt="Dayparting gb1" /></div>
							<figcaption>Figure 1: Day parting chart for a GB1 marketing campaign</figcaption>
							<p>
								Regarding the frequency cap, the objective was to determine the optimal number of advertisements to display to a consumer for optimal 
								results. After obtaining the query results, the key performance indicators (KPIs) of purchase rate and return on advertising spend (ROAS) were 
								utilized to identify the optimal values. The analysis unfolded in two stages: initially, the number of impressions was aggregated into 
								groups of 5. For instance, if a user viewed an ad once within a 30-day period, the user would fall into the 1 to 5 ads group. 
								Subsequently, the analysis was refined by adjusting the query to capture more detailed values. Instead of using frequency groups, 
								individual frequencies were treated as distinct groups. In the given example, the user would now be categorized in the 1 ad group. For 
								each of these groups, the percentage of users falling into them was computed. Two separate charts were generated for each campaign under 
								examination. One chart compared the purchase rate and the number of users in each group, while the other chart compared the purchase 
								rate for each group with the corresponding <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the outcomes of the initial phase of the analysis for GB1 shavers campaigns, while Figures 4 and 5 depict 
								the second phase of the analysis for the same campaigns. Notably, the first part of the analysis yields results that lack granularity, 
								preventing the identification of precise optimal frequency values. In the first phase, the selected campaign exhibits its optimal 
								frequency cap value between 6 to 10 advertisements per month, as indicated by the highest <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span> and purchase rate within that range. 
								Conversely, the second part introduces more detailed frequency values. For the specific campaign depicted in the charts, the optimal 
								frequency cap is determined to be 10 advertisements per month, aligning with the peak <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span> and purchase rate.

							<h4>Media vehicles</h4>
							<p>
								In this segment of the analysis, the aim was to understand the collective and individual effectiveness of different types of advertisements. 
								The exposure groups, or media types, chosen for comparison included <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign includes the advertisements shown to a consumer when they search for products on Amazon" data-tooltip-big>Sponsored Advertisements (Search Ads)</span>, <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Advertisements</span>, and <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Marketing packages for visibility that can be purchased by companies to boost marketing performance during seasonal periods, in which sales as typically higher, for example Black Friday or Amazon’s Prime Day." data-tooltip-big>Share of Voice</span>
								packages. The objective was to assess the performance of these three advertisement types during peak periods (Black Friday and Prime 
								Day) and off-peak periods, determining if their utilization justifies the expenditure. The analysis involved querying AMC for all the specified 
								months relevant to the investigation.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the initial analysis, the focus was on comparing <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign includes the advertisements shown to a consumer when they search for products on Amazon" data-tooltip-big>Sponsored Advertisements</span> and <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Advertisements</span>, with <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Marketing packages for visibility that can be purchased by companies to boost marketing performance during seasonal periods, in which sales as typically higher, for example Black Friday or Amazon’s Prime Day." data-tooltip-big>Share of Voice</span> packages earmarked 
								for future examination. Each comparison was conducted on a brand basis, with the selected brands being GB1 and GB2. Upon retrieving the query 
								results for the chosen months, key performance indicators (KPIs) used to gauge success, including <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span> and purchase rate, along with other 
								values relevant for comparison, such as the percentage of total impressions and percentage of total sales attributed to an exposure group for 
								that period, were calculated. These <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Key Performance Indicators" data-tooltip-fit>KPIs</span> were computed individually for each brand and exposure group. Subsequently, a chart was generated to 
								visually represent the <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span> for each brand in the selected month and exposure group. The outcomes are depicted in Figures 6 and 7, covering 
								the period from August 2021 to June 2022.
							</p>
							<p>
								Regarding GB1, it's evident that, for the majority of months, employing both <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display</span> and <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign includes the advertisements shown to a consumer when they search for products on Amazon" data-tooltip-big>Search</span> advertisements proves advantageous in terms of 
								<span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span>. <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Advertisements</span> consistently exhibit lower <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span> values when used independently, primarily due to their high impression numbers, 
								as they are predominantly employed for maximizing reach. In the case of GB2, the effectiveness of utilizing both <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign includes the advertisements shown to a consumer when they search for products on Amazon" data-tooltip-big>Search</span> and <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Advertisements</span> 
								is observed only in particular months. There are instances when <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Advertisements</span> are not utilized at all, corresponding to months where 
								the <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span> chart displays zero values for <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display</span>.

							<figcaption>Figure 6: ROAS for each exposure group by month – GB1</figcaption>
							<div class="image center"><img class="center" src="https://github.com/joaovargass/joaovargass.github.io/assets/39708920/b1b653bc-e47b-4b57-bba3-e0ab48b3a171" alt="Media vehicles gb2" /></div>
							<figcaption>Figure 7: ROAS for each exposure group by month – GB2</figcaption>
							<p>
								To get a general picture of the use of both types of advertisements, the comparison values were summed for all the months in analysis, and the 
								results were put in a table for each brand. For both GB1 and GB2, most part of the impressions come from <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Advertisements</span>, but the <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span> 
								and purchase rate for this exposure group are very low. For GB1, as shown on Table 2, using the combination of both types of advertisements 
								gives the best results. For GB2, observing the results on Table 3, the purchase rate is better when overlapping the advertisements, but the 
								<span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span> is better when using only <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign includes the advertisements shown to a consumer when they search for products on Amazon" data-tooltip-big>Search ads</span>.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a conclusion, it is noticeable that for GB1, the use of both advertisements is important. For GB2, the recommendation is that the overlap 
								of media vehicles should be done, but not on all months. The focus should be on using both of the them on peak period. For all tables, M stands 
								for thousand and MM for million.

								As a second phase of this analysis, it is imperative to explore the impact of introducing <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Marketing packages for visibility that can be purchased by companies to boost marketing performance during seasonal periods, in which sales as typically higher, for example Black Friday or Amazon’s Prime Day." data-tooltip-big>Share of Voice</span> (SoV) as a new exposure group 
								on sales performance. To achieve this, understanding the specific periods during which the company procured <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Marketing packages for visibility that can be purchased by companies to boost marketing performance during seasonal periods, in which sales as typically higher, for example Black Friday or Amazon’s Prime Day." data-tooltip-big>SoV</span> packages for the selected 
								brands is crucial, given that this type of advertisement is typically seasonal and procured during peak periods. Among the analyzed brands, 
								GB1 is the only one that utilized this type of advertisement. Consequently, two peak months, July 2022 (Prime Day) and October 2022 
								(second Prime Day), were chosen to incorporate this new variable.
							</p>
							<p>
								New queries were executed on AMC, incorporating the new exposure group for each of the selected months. The outcomes are presented in Tables 
								4 and 5. It is discernible that the utilization of <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Marketing packages for visibility that can be purchased by companies to boost marketing performance during seasonal periods, in which sales as typically higher, for example Black Friday or Amazon’s Prime Day." data-tooltip-big>SoV</span> packages proves advantageous during peak periods, exhibiting higher <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span> and Purchase 
								Rates, particularly when combined with <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign includes the advertisements shown to a consumer when they search for products on Amazon" data-tooltip-big>Search ads</span>. Additionally, favorable results are observed when there is a triple overlap among the

							<h4>Campaign paths</h4>
							<p>
								The analysis focused on understanding various campaign paths leading to a purchase, considering the sequence and frequency of <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign includes the advertisements shown to a consumer when they search for products on Amazon" data-tooltip-big>Search</span> and 
								<span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="This type of marketing campaign is related to the advertisements that appear on the top or sides across Amazon’s website. It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Ads</span>. Key metrics for comparison included the starting and ending types of advertisements, path occurrences, purchase rate, <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span>, 
								average path length, and the percentage of total occurrences for each path type. Tables 6 and 7 reveal that paths starting and ending with

It is usually a message with a call-to-action type of button and it has high visibility across the website." data-tooltip-big>Display Ads</span> ads have the highest occurrences but exhibit the lowest purchase rate.

							<h4>Time lag for purchase</h4>
							<p>
								In this analysis, consumer interactions with advertisements within 15 days of exposure were examined. The study focused on three main 
								actions: Purchase, Add to Shopping Cart, and See Detail Page after viewing an advertisement. The data, spanning 12 months and divided 
								into 15-day intervals, revealed insights such as the time elapsed after ad exposure, user actions over time, and the percentage of total 
								purchases within the 15-day period. Analyzing GB1 and GB2 from June 2021 to April 2022, Figures 8 and 9 illustrated similar consumer behavior, 
								emphasizing a significant conversion peak two days after ad exposure, contributing to over 50% of total sales during that period.

								In the analysis of consumer audiences on Amazon Marketing Cloud, the focus was on identifying high-performing segments for each brand, GB1 
								and GB2. Consumer audiences represent groups with similar purchasing patterns, enabling targeted advertising based on interests and 
								improving overall performance compared to generic targeting. For each brand, the analysis involved displaying total product sales in 
								euros, calculating <span data-tooltip data-tooltip-message="Return On Advertising Spend" data-tooltip-fit>ROAS</span>, purchase rate, and the percentage of sales attributed to new-to-brand (NTB) users. NTB users are defined as those 
								who haven't purchased any products from a brand in the last 12 months. The analysis covered the period from August 2021 to June 2022.

								Table 8 displays GB1's top-performing segments, while Table 9 presents GB2's. Notably, the first two segments in both tables are broad and 
								general, with the more specific descriptions in subsequent segments proving to be more crucial for the brands. Additionally, GB1 exhibits a 
								higher percentage of consumers who are new to the brand compared to GB2. This suggests that GB2's consumers show a higher inclination towards 
								repurchasing products.

								In the next phase of the analysis, the focus was on identifying the most lucrative age groups for each brand in terms of sales. 
								This involved utilizing AMC segments that categorize consumers based on age. Additionally, the analysis explored the performance 
								of different devices (Personal Computer, Phone, Tablet) for each age group. The results, presented in Table 10 for GB1 and Table 11 
								for GB2, highlight that age groups 35 to 44 and 45 to 54 contribute significantly to sales for both brands. Phones are the primary 
								sales device for GB1, while Personal Computers (PCs) dominate for GB2. Notably, GB2's consumer base exhibits a higher proportion of 
								repeat purchasers. An interesting observation is that Tablets, despite contributing less to sales, demonstrate the highest return on 
								advertising spend (ROAS) across most groups.
